# metcourse

Scripts for simulating metabolic time-course data from suspension cell cultures and correcting systematic deviations.

# Current state

This repository contains the code used in the publication of "A correction method for systematic error in 1H-NMR time-course data validated through stochastic cell culture simulation". As it stands, the scripts are contained as "Additional files" submitted with the manuscript. Any further development to the published methods will be reflected here.
