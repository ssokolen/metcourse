# metcourse

Scripts for simulating metabolic time-course data from suspension cell cultures and correcting systematic deviations.

# Original code

The original code in this repository was used in the publication of "A correction method for systematic error in 1H-NMR time-course data validated through stochastic cell culture simulation". While the repository is under development, the original publication code can be found under R/original.

# Current state

The code is being transitioned from a set of scripts to an R package. In
the process, some functionality is likely to change from its original form.
